PatanHospital
=============

This is a project developed by students of Loyola University Chicago for  Open Source Computing(COMP 412). We gratefully acknowledge professor Matthew Butcher(github technosophos) for his support to build this project.

This is an application developed primarily to make interaction in the hospital environment easier. It creates a bridge between the doctors, patients and administrators.  There are primarily 3 end users, Administrator, Doctor and a patient. PatanHospital works as a basic structure that can be applied to any hospital environment and can be easily customized.

The project is developed in Visual studio 2010. The backend server used is MS Server 2008. The server is hosted on  sql.cs.luc.edu.

The later versions will have the following features: Administrator can delete patient/doctor information, reserve appointments for patients over the phone, edit the reservations, patients can reserve appointment themselves, email notification upon reserving an appointment, any edit on the reservation and deletion of the reservation.

A group forum/Email list has been created using Google groups.All release information as well as ideas will be discussed on the forum. Simply submit a request and you will added to the forum thereafter. the link to the forum:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/patenthospitalgroup  

Finally we will be using Github as our Version Control System.
